				John Stezaker has created the limited edition print, 'Recto/Verso' (2012) exclusively for Counter Editions. The image arose from Stezaker's early 'Dark Star' series of silhouettes cut out from mid-century actor's portraits. The layered profiles confound a straightforward reading of presence and absence. The overlaying of male and female profiles, of colour and shadow, of empty flatness and carefully modelled detail, gives rise to sensations of nostalgia, romanticism, and perhaps of voyeurism.

				John Stezaker intervenes with found images - typically old film stills, vintage postcards, or Hollywood headshots - by excising critical parts of the composition or by juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated images. His concise alterations have surprising surreal effect and psychological force. In a world saturated by images, Stezaker's manipulations create space both physically and metaphorically for alternative interpretations, for exploring the seams and fissures of the visual world.
